November 8th, 2017: 
Each CUDA block will be responsible for calculating the estimated displacement for one point in the image. 
Each thread performs cross correlation for two matrices of size = processing kernel size.  (nested for loops) 
Each block will calculate the index containing the peak CC value. 
The kernel will send back the axial and lateral displacement map. 
In shared memory: pre data, CC map
For next time: 
Rob - xcorr implementation hw style
Rashid – looking into .mex file 
Michael – looking into sorting/peak finding and max index. 


November 10th, 2017
Profiling the MATLAB code (linux)
Recommendations to pre-allocate matrices for speed. pad_level_x,y cells, commented out some unused variables. 
Normxcorr2_mex is taking 80% of the time. (RM,MT)


November 13th, 2017
Debugged the cuda kernel. The center value is correct for for 5x5 matrix. Tested with matlab generated array. 
Need to pass structure to mex and from mex to kernel.
Do max inside of the kernel along with the subsample displacement? (RM,RP,MT)

MATLAB code: 
im = randi([-10 10],50,1)';
fileID = fopen('testInputs.inp','w');
fprintf(fileID,'%i \r\n',im);
fclose(fileID);

November 16th, 2017
Discussed execution model for multilevel algorithm and data structures. (RM,MT)

November 17th, 2017
Implemented a new iteration of the cuda kernel for CC. Results are not agreeing 100% with MATLAB. (RM,MT)

November 20th, 2017
Some bugs in the code. Results are now agreeing 100% with MATLAB. (RM,MT)

November 22nd, 2017
Team meeting to discuss next milestones for the project. RM presented all the changes since Nov 13th. (RP) will look into shared memory with post data. We want to get the mex setup working and profile the code. 

November 27th, 2017
Post data into shared memory almost completed with few bugs. (RP)

November 28th, 2017
Discussed Shared Memory usage. Determined that using shared memory for post means/variances will go outside of allotted shared memory. Decided to share (fixed) pre data instead of post data. (RM,RP)
Began investigation of using nvvp. (MT)
Further investigation of Constant memory vs Texture memory. (RP)

November 30th, 2017
0. Unable to utilize shared memory unless the kernel size is small. 
1. MEX implementation for normxcorr.
2. CPU and GPU xcorr maps compared and found to be similar.
3. Peak finding using 2D reduction.
Issues:
1) Currently limited by threads per block (1024)
2) Peak finding fails for large CC maps. Investigating today.
3) Need to investigate the data transfer overhead between MATLAB and the GPU. (matlab to mex, mex to cuda)
4) Investigate pinned memory for pre and post.
